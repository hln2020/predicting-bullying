# Optimizing Models for Predicting Bullying in Adolescents


Recent research conducted by cyberbullying.org has revealed an alarming trend: the incidence of bullying in schools surged by a concerning 35% between 2016 and 2019. This alarming increase in bullying has far-reaching consequences, particularly in terms of traumatic stress reactions, including the development of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The National Child Traumatic Stress Network's findings shed light on the severity of this issue, indicating that a substantial percentage of students who have been subjected to bullying, with 27.6% of male students and a staggering 40.5% of female students, fall within the clinical range for PTSD levels.

These alarming statistics underscore the urgency of addressing and preventing bullying in educational settings. To mitigate the adverse consequences associated with bullying and reduce the number of students impacted, our objective is to employ machine learning algorithms developed from scratch to predict the likelihood of a student falling victim to bullying. Furthermore, we intend to optimize these algorithms for efficiency and speed, ultimately contributing to a safer and more supportive school environment for all students.
